# Data Science Portfolio

Here are some of my best Data Science Projects. I have explored various machine-learning algorithms for different datasets. Feel free to contact me to learn more about my experience working with these projects.

[Examining the effect of environmental factors and weather on demand of Bike rentals](https://github.com/Muluken1Walle/ProjectLinearRegression)

<img src="images/seoul-bikes.jpeg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib

**Project Objective:** Predicting Bike rental demand on basis of weather and seasonal factors in advance to take appropiate measures which finally will result in bike utilization.

**Quantifiable result:** We could predict the Bike rental demand resulting in [**55%** accuracy](https://github.com/Muluken1Walle/ProjectLinearRegression).

- Used Random Forest Regressor to predict the number of bikes rented in the city of Seoul
- The data had quite a few categorical variables which were encoded for use in the model
- Encoded categorical variables to numeric using Sklearn due to the presence of many string columns
- Cross Validation for validating the training data and model fit.
- Fit a Random Forest Regressor with high prediction accuracy through iteration

[Portuguese Bank Marketing Analysis](https://github.com/Muluken1Walle/Logistic_Regression_Project)

<img src="images/bank.jpeg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib

**Project Objective:**In this project I worked with real world data which is related with direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution.
The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit.

**Quantifiable result:** We could Classify whether client has subscribed the term deposit or not [**85%** accuracy using Logistic Regression algorithm](https://github.com/Muluken1Walle/Logistic_Regression_Project).

- Used logistic regression to classify whether term deposit is subscribed or not.
- Classified subscription depending on selected important features.
- Used SMOTE to balance dataset.
- Explored a machine learning approach to marketing analysis.

[Hand Written Digits Recognisation](https://github.com/Muluken1Walle/Deep-Neural-Network-with-Keras-for-MNIST-handwritten-classification-and-recognition/blob/main/Deep_Neural_Network_with_Keras_for_MNIST_handwritten_classification_and_recognition.ipynb)

<img src="images/mnist.png?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Keras, Tensorflow

**Project Objective:** Mnist is a dataset with 70,000 of hand written digits. Here I have predicted the mnist digits by using Convolution Nural Network.

**Quantifiable result:** We could train the Convolutional Neural Network to attain a accuracy of [**92%**](https://github.com/Muluken1Walle/Deep-Neural-Network-with-Keras-for-MNIST-handwritten-classification-and-recognition/blob/main/Deep_Neural_Network_with_Keras_for_MNIST_handwritten_classification_and_recognition.ipyn).

- Added multiple convolution and pooling layers
- Training model on basis of Mnist data
- Data Source: MNIST
- Trained model with 8 epochs.
